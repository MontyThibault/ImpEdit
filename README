To do:


-> Fix scollbar bugs
	-> Fast scrolling inverts graph
	-> Inverted graph does not render properly (insert some Math.abs's)

-> n-pixel padding
-> Waveform scrubber
-> Begin on Laplace editor. (WebGL implementation)


-> Implement log and axial scaling



FFT EQ (this should be very easy)

Hook up convolver with graph editor (convolver currently doesn't work for an unknown reason)
Fix clicking bug with FFT (didn't work first time...)
Choppy canvas animation? Don't know why...
