To do:


-> Implement viewport scaling from handle corners.
-> Waveform scrubber
-> Music file selection dialogue

-> Units on graph labels


Create limits for editor elements, distinct from the window limits.
Or maybe include an n-pixel padding.



Begin on Laplace editor. (WebGL implementation)
FFT EQ (this should be very easy)


Hook up convolver with graph editor (convolver currently doesn't work for an unknown reason)
Fix clicking bug with FFT (didn't work first time...)
