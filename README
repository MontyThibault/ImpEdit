To do:

-> Set buffer to dirac-delta by default

-> Add disable button
-> Disable listeners button

-> Fix clicking bug with FFT (didn't work first time...)

-> Play pure tone button
-> Increase controls width


-> Delegate Laplace rendering to seperate webworker
-> Implement axial scaling
-> Variable buffer length
-> Code review
	-> axis.orientationf can be used with bind()
