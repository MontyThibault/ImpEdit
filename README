To do:


-> Handle bug (drag until it's too small -> can't drag anymore)
-> Handle inversion bug


-> Implement log coloring in webGL script


-> n-pixel padding


-> Fix clicking bug with FFT (didn't work first time...)

-> Do something about variable buffer length


////////
// End of weekend goals



-> Implement axial scaling for oscillator phase and magnitude

-> Add a "convert to IR" button that destroys oscillators

-> Graphical table to edit oscillator values

-> Consider spline interpolation on the line



-> Waveform scrubber

-> Revise needsUpdate hack to make more efficient


Convert to classes
Change buffer size; automatically recompile shaders






FFT EQ (this should be very easy)


Choppy canvas animation? Don't know why...
