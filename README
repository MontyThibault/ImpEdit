To do:



-> Fix clicking bug with FFT (didn't work first time...)

-> Implement axial scaling for oscillator phase and magnitude
-> Graphical table to edit oscillator values


-> Set up some sort of interactive interface screen, where you can choose a frequency, it sets the lowpass filter, then change sliders for damping, phase, amplitude at that frequency.


	-> Frequency chosen at random
	-> Set the lowpass to the frequency

	-> Sliders to adjust:
		-> Damping
		-> Amplitude
		-> Phase



	-> Implement amplitude and phase changesa

	-> Better name than editor and editor0


-> Change buffer length in GLSL_frag shader (and performance updates)
	-> Maybe webworker off-canvas rendering?


--------------------------------------

-> Consider spline interpolation on the line

-> Do something about variable buffer length
-> Add a "convert to IR" button that destroys oscillators


-> Waveform scrubber




------------

-> Revise needsUpdate hack to make more efficient

-> Convert to classes








FFT EQ (this should be very easy)
-> n-pixel padding


Choppy canvas animation? Don't know why...
