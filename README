To do:


-> Performance improvements
-> Add auto-normalize
-> Add gain slider

-> Fixed special labels & lines (for axes and titles)


-> Fix clicking bug with FFT (didn't work first time...)

-> Implement axial scaling for oscillator phase and magnitude
-> Graphical table to edit oscillator values


-> Set up some sort of interactive interface screen, where you can choose a frequency, it sets the lowpass filter, then change sliders for damping, phase, amplitude at that frequency.


	-> Frequency chosen at random
	-> Set the lowpass to the frequency

	-> Sliders to adjust:
		-> Damping
		-> Amplitude
		-> Phase




-> Change buffer length in GLSL_frag shader (and performance updates)
	-> Maybe webworker off-canvas rendering?
