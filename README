To do:


-> Make a major-line labeling system with special labels and lines drawn on sidebars.
	Can be used to implement units on graph labels.

-> Generalize things turning red on hover and have drag difference.

-> n-pixel padding

-> smooth scrolling
-> scroll towards cursor
-> scroll scale box




-> Waveform scrubber



Begin on Laplace editor. (WebGL implementation)
FFT EQ (this should be very easy)


Hook up convolver with graph editor (convolver currently doesn't work for an unknown reason)
Fix clicking bug with FFT (didn't work first time...)
